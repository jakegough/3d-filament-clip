Clips to keep track of the end of 3D printer filament on a spool.  Authored in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html).

Inspired by the [1.75mm filament spool clip](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1728070) on Thingiverse, but I needed one to work with [Monoprice filament](http://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=11043) spools (I know, 
the Monoprice spools already have a built-in feature to keep the end from getting lost... but sometimes it's a pain to use.)

I also added two improvements:

1. I beveled the jaw that holds the filament.  I was having troubles with [elephant foot](https://all3dp.com/common-3d-printing-problems-3d-printer-troubleshooting-guide/#Elephant%20Foot) throwing off the dimensions of the bottom layers and making the filament fit too tight or not at all, and this fixed the problem.

1. I tapered the inside edge hoping I can leave the clip on while printing without snagging.  Time will tell if this feature works as expected.
